My name is XIAO Junren, and I am currently a Mphil. Student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) with major: Artificial intelligence (AI). I completed my undergraduate studies at the Hong Kong Baptist University with major: Finance. My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and Finance, an exciting and rapidly evolving field.

My specific research focus is on Financial Technology (FinTech), Transfer Learning, and Large-scale Language Models (LLM). In the realm of FinTech, I am captivated by the transformative power of technology and how it can revolutionize traditional financial systems, making them more efficient, accessible, and inclusive. In terms of Transfer Learning, I am fascinated by the ability of this technique to leverage knowledge from one domain to improve learning in another. This approach is particularly valuable in situations where data is scarce or expensive to collect. Finally, my interest in Large-scale Language Models stems from their potential to understand and generate human-like text. These models are incredibly versatile, with applications ranging from automated customer service to providing assistance in complex decision-making processes.

I am eager to explore these areas further and contribute to advancements in these fields during my time at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My unique blend of skills and interests will enable me to contribute significantly to academia and industry.
